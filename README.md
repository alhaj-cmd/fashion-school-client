#- JWT authentication
- The project integrates JWT for user authentication and authorization, Axios for seamless API communication, MongoDB for efficient data storage, and React form components and hooks for building interactive forms.

Users can register, log in, and access protected resources using JWT. The backend generates tokens upon successful authentication, which are securely stored on the client-side and sent with API requests to verify user identity and authorize access to protected routes.
# Axios
- Axios simplifies communication between the React frontend and the backend API. It handles asynchronous requests, seamlessly integrates with React components, and allows for sending form data, retrieving responses, and handling errors.
# MongoDB
- MongoDB serves as the data storage solution, providing efficient and scalable persistence for user-related data, form submissions, and other relevant information.

- React form components, along with React hooks, enable the creation of user-friendly forms. The components provide structured input fields, while React hooks like useState and useEffect facilitate state management and data handling within the forms.

- JWT, Axios, MongoDB, React form components, and React hooks, the project delivers a comprehensive web application. Users can securely authenticate, interact with forms, submit data, and have their information stored reliably, enhancing the overall user experience.
